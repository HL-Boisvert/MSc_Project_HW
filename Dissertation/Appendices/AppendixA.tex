Those three race tracks will be used to evaluate the performance of the controllers. They have been chosen because they present different types of challenges, with combinations of long straight lines and sharp corners.

\section{Formula 1 Track - Red Bull Ring}
The race track for training the controllers is based on the Red Bull Ring race track, located in Austria and hosting the Austrian Grand Prix. the \verb |.png| file that will be used in ROS (Figure \ref{redbull}) is based on \cite{wikiredbull}.

This oval race track was designed by myself and is used to evaluate the sim-to-real gap.
